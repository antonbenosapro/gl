## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

| Component | Average Time | Max Time | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **CSRF Token Generation** | 0.001ms | 0.008ms | <1.0ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **CSRF Token Validation** | 0.000ms | 0.004ms | <0.5ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Session Creation** | 0.010ms | 0.049ms | <2.0ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Session Validation** | 0.008ms | 0.019ms | <1.0ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Failed Login Recording** | 0.020ms | 0.180ms | <0.5ms | ✅ GOOD |
| **IP Suspicious Check** | 0.003ms | 0.015ms | <0.1ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **IP Detection** | 0.123ms | 1.245ms | <0.5ms | ✅ GOOD |
| **User Agent Detection** | 0.087ms | 0.892ms | <0.5ms | ✅ GOOD |

## 🧠 Memory Usage Analysis

- **Current Memory Usage**: 1.23 MB
- **Peak Memory Usage**: 2.67 MB  
- **Memory Threshold**: <10.0 MB
- **Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT (73% under threshold)

## 🔧 Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue #1: Timing Inconsistency in Security Monitor
- **Problem**: `record_failed_login()` used `datetime.utcnow().timestamp()` while `is_ip_suspicious()` used `time.time()`
- **Impact**: Failed login tracking was not working correctly
- **Resolution**: Standardized all timestamp operations to use `time.time()` for consistency
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Test State Interference  
- **Problem**: Security monitor tests were interfering with each other due to shared state
- **Impact**: 4% test failure rate initially
- **Resolution**: Enhanced test isolation and unique IP addresses per test
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 🛡️ Security Validation

### Threat Mitigation Verified

| Threat | Mitigation | Test Status |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **CSRF Attacks** | Secure token validation with constant-time comparison | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Session Hijacking** | HMAC-signed session cookies with tampering detection | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Brute Force Attacks** | Rate limiting + IP-based monitoring + account lockouts | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Session Fixation** | Token regeneration on login + secure session management | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Information Disclosure** | Generic error messages + proper client IP detection | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **Timing Attacks** | Constant-time token comparison operations | ✅ VERIFIED |

### Security Alerting Validated
