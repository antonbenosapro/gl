# Foreign Currency (FX) Revaluation System - Deep Dive Analysis

## Executive Summary
The FX revaluation system is a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution that handles foreign currency translation, revaluation, and compliance with ASC 830 (US GAAP) and IAS 21 (IFRS) accounting standards. The system was implemented in August 2025 as part of the GL modernization project.
