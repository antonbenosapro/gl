## ‚úÖ Task 1: Fix Exchange Difference Classification Edge Case
**Status: COMPLETED** 

### Issue Identified
The net investment classification logic was incorrectly prioritizing transaction differences over net investment items, causing test failures.

### Solution Implemented
**File Modified:** `utils/ias21_compliance_service.py`
- **Line 77-105:** Reordered classification logic to check net investment first
- **Logic Flow:** Net Investment ‚Üí Transaction Differences ‚Üí Non-monetary items

### Testing Results
```python
# Before Fix: TRANSACTION_DIFFERENCES ‚ùå
# After Fix:  NET_INVESTMENT ‚úÖ

Test Result: NET_INVESTMENT ‚Üí TRANSLATION_RESERVE
Match: True ‚úÖ
```

### Business Impact
- ‚úÖ Proper IAS 21.15 net investment identification
- ‚úÖ Correct OCI vs P&L classification 
- ‚úÖ Compliant with IAS 21.32-33 requirements

## ‚úÖ Task 2: Optimize Translation Method Result Processing  
**Status: COMPLETED**

### Issues Identified
Query result processing was failing due to incorrect tuple indexing when accessing database results.

### Solution Implemented
**File Modified:** `utils/translation_methods_service.py`
- **Lines 168-180:** Added `.mappings()` to database query execution
- **Lines 202-214:** Added null-safe result processing
- **Lines 240-252:** Enhanced error handling for missing data

### Improvements Made
```python
# Before: 
result = conn.execute(query).fetchall()  # Tuple indexing ‚ùå

# After:
result = conn.execute(query).mappings().fetchall()  # Dict access ‚úÖ
```

### Performance Impact
- ‚úÖ Eliminated "tuple indices must be integers" errors
- ‚úÖ Improved query result reliability
- ‚úÖ Enhanced null handling for missing exchange rates
