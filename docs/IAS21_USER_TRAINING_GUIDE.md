## IAS 21 Fundamentals

### What is IAS 21?
IAS 21 "The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" is the IFRS standard governing foreign currency accounting. It addresses:
- **Functional currency determination** 
- **Foreign currency transaction recording**
- **Translation of foreign operations**
- **Exchange difference classification**
- **Required disclosures**

### Key Concepts

#### 1. **Functional Currency (IAS 21.9-14)**
The currency of the primary economic environment where the entity operates.

**Assessment Factors:**
- Currency that mainly influences sales prices
- Currency of country whose competitive forces determine sales prices  
- Currency that mainly influences labor, material, and other costs
- Currency in which funds from financing activities are generated
- Currency in which operating activities receipts are usually retained

#### 2. **Exchange Differences Classification**
- **Transaction Differences (Para 28-29):** Recognized in P&L immediately
- **Translation Differences (Para 39):** Recognized in OCI for net investments
- **Net Investment Differences (Para 32-33):** Recognized in OCI, recycled on disposal

#### 3. **Translation Methods**
- **Current Rate Method:** All assets/liabilities at closing rate, equity at historical rates
- **Temporal Method:** Monetary items at current rates, non-monetary at historical rates

## Exchange Difference Classification

### Step-by-Step Process

‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Transaction Difference (P&L)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Net Investment (OCI)
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Is it measured at fair value?
   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Follow fair value accounting location
   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Historical cost (no exchange differences)
```
