## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify database credentials in `db_config.py`
   - Check PostgreSQL service status
   - Validate connection string format

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Review query optimization
   - Check database indexes
   - Monitor system resources

3. **Missing Data**
   - Verify table relationships
   - Check data pipeline integrity
   - Review filter settings

### Error Messages

#### "No workflows found"
- **Cause**: Filters too restrictive or no data in period
- **Solution**: Adjust date range or clear filters

#### "Database connection failed"
- **Cause**: Database service unavailable
- **Solution**: Check PostgreSQL status and credentials

#### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Insufficient user permissions
- **Solution**: Verify user role and admin access

### Performance Tuning

1. **Database Optimization**
   ```sql
   -- Add indexes for common queries
   CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_status ON workflow_instances(status);
   CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_created ON workflow_instances(created_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_approval_steps_workflow ON approval_steps(workflow_instance_id);
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Use LIMIT clauses for large datasets
   - Implement proper JOIN strategies
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Use session state for data caching
   - Implement lazy loading for charts
   - Optimize re-render triggers
