## ⚠️ Important Notes & Troubleshooting

### **🔑 First Login Requirements:**
- All new users **must change password** on first login
- System will prompt for new password meeting security requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Cannot reuse last 3 passwords

- **manager1** is currently delegated to **supervisor1** (Aug 15-25, 2025)
- During delegation period, supervisor1 can approve Manager-level entries

### **🔐 Security & Compliance:**
- All approvers have `journal.approve` permission
- Role-based access controls enforced throughout system
- Complete audit trail maintained for all workflow actions
- SOX compliance with segregation of duties enforcement
