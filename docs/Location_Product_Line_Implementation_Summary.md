## Architecture Overview

### **Hybrid Approach Implementation**

The implementation follows a **hybrid model** that combines:

1. **Location Master Data** - 6-digit codes for hierarchical geographic organization
2. **Product Line Master Data** - 6-digit codes for industry-specific product portfolio management  
3. **Cost Center/Profit Center Coding** - Combined structure: `Product Line ID (6) + Location Code (6) = 12-digit code`

### **Key Design Principles**

    A[Product Lines] --> C[Cost/Profit Centers]

    C --> E[GL Transactions]

    B --> B1[111110 - NYC HQ]
    C --> C1[111000111110 - Combined Code]
```

## Database Implementation

### **1. Reporting Locations Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE reporting_locations (
    location_code VARCHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,  -- 6-digit location code
    location_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location_level VARCHAR(20),             -- GLOBAL, REGION, COUNTRY, STATE, CITY, SITE, BUILDING, FLOOR
    parent_location VARCHAR(6),             -- Hierarchical structure
    country_code VARCHAR(3),
    business_area_id VARCHAR(4),
    location_type VARCHAR(20),              -- HEADQUARTERS, OFFICE, PLANT, WAREHOUSE, STORE, DC
    is_manufacturing BOOLEAN,
    is_sales BOOLEAN,
    is_distribution BOOLEAN,
    -- ... additional 20+ fields for complete location management
);
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```
000001 - Global Headquarters (GLOBAL)
├── 100000 - North America Region (REGION)
│   ├── 110000 - United States (COUNTRY)
│   │   ├── 111000 - USA - East (STATE)
│   │   │   ├── 111100 - New York City (CITY)
│   │   │   │   └── 111110 - NYC Headquarters (SITE)
│   │   │   │       ├── 111111 - NYC HQ - Building A (BUILDING)
│   │   │   │       └── 111112 - NYC HQ - Building B (BUILDING)
```

### **2. Product Lines Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_lines (
    product_line_id VARCHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,  -- 6-digit product line code
    product_line_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    parent_product_line VARCHAR(6),          -- Hierarchical structure
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    lifecycle_stage VARCHAR(20),             -- DEVELOPMENT, INTRODUCTION, GROWTH, MATURITY, DECLINE
    industry_sector VARCHAR(50),             -- CPG, PHARMA, AUTO, TECH, etc.
    is_manufactured BOOLEAN,
    is_service BOOLEAN,
    requires_serialization BOOLEAN,
    -- ... additional 25+ fields for complete product management
);
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```
100000 - Consumer Electronics
├── 110000 - Mobile Devices
│   ├── 111000 - Smartphones
│   │   ├── 111100 - Premium Smartphones
│   │   └── 111200 - Budget Smartphones
├── 120000 - Computing Devices
│   ├── 121000 - Laptops
│   └── 122000 - Tablets
```

### **3. Cost/Profit Center Mapping Tables**

```sql
CREATE TABLE cost_center_location_product (
    cost_center_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    location_code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
    product_line_id VARCHAR(6),
    generated_code VARCHAR(12) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        COALESCE(product_line_id, '000000') || location_code
    ) STORED
);
```

---

## Coding Structure

### **Cost Center/Profit Center Code Format**

**Structure:** `PPPPPPLLLLLL` (Product Line + Location)

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Smartphones in NYC Headquarters
Product Line: 111000 (Smartphones)
Location:     111110 (NYC Headquarters)
Generated:    111000111110

-- ERP Solutions in Munich Office  
Product Line: 211000 (Financial ERP)
Location:     211110 (Munich Office)
Generated:    211000211110

-- Location-only (no product line)
Product Line: 000000 (Default)
Location:     111110 (NYC Headquarters)
Generated:    000000111110
```

### **Helper Functions**

```sql
-- Generate codes
SELECT generate_cost_center_code('111000', '111110'); 
-- Returns: 111000111110

-- Decode codes
SELECT * FROM decode_center_code('111000111110');
-- Returns: product_line_id='111000', location_code='111110'
```

## Integration Points

### **1. Enhanced Views for Reporting**

```sql
-- Cost Center with Location/Product Context
CREATE VIEW v_cost_center_enhanced AS
SELECT 
    cc.costcenterid,
    cc.name AS cost_center_name,
    rl.location_name,
    rl.country_code,
    pl.product_line_name,
    pl.lifecycle_stage,
    clp.generated_code
FROM costcenter cc
LEFT JOIN cost_center_location_product clp ON cc.costcenterid = clp.cost_center_id
LEFT JOIN reporting_locations rl ON clp.location_code = rl.location_code
LEFT JOIN product_lines pl ON clp.product_line_id = pl.product_line_id;
```

### **2. Hierarchical Views**

```sql
-- Location Hierarchy with Full Paths
SELECT location_code, full_path, level 
FROM v_location_hierarchy 
WHERE level <= 3;

-- Result: Global Headquarters > North America Region > United States > USA - East

-- Product Hierarchy with Categories
SELECT product_line_id, full_path, level
FROM v_product_line_hierarchy
WHERE level <= 2;

-- Result: Consumer Electronics > Mobile Devices > Smartphones
```
